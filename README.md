# Movies List API

#### Description: 
API for the Android application [Movies List](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jgm.euvi&pli=1). It was built in Node.js and for storage I use MongoDb for user related data and RedisGraph for social interactions such as likes, follows and ratings. 

I get the movies and series data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

The app was built to be social, but I removed the comments and likes features to simplify it. It was my first large application, so the code needs a lot of refactoring and organizing, which I will do as soon as I can.
